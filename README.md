# Corner_Grocer

This program is meant to take a file with a list of items from a grocery list, read it, map it, and display the frequency of each item in the list. The first option the user has is to view the frequency of one item that they searched for. Another option the user can select reads the entire text file and returns all of the items and their frequency in the list. The last option shows a histogram of each item and their frequency in the text file by replacing the number of times the item appears with an asterisk. I believe the thing I did best with this project was keeping code down to a minimum. By having only six user defined functions and one class, it is greatly cutting down on compiling time. One thing I feel could enhance my code would be the addition of a function to map the text file, that way I didn't have to write the same code three times for the map. The piece I found the most challenging was figurilng out how to save and make the text file searchable. Initially, I tried to save the text file to a vector but that ended up with a lot more code since it has to be done within the class, and I knew using an array would create a longer compiling time and less security, so I searched other ways to create lists and found a tutorial on creating and iterating over maps. Through my use of naming conventions, this code should be easily readable and maintainable.
